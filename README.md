## Project Description
* The project involves analyzing NHANES 2017-18 examination data on oral health dentition and demographic information.
* This can be used to study the prevalence of dental caries among U.S. adults.
* The analysis focuses on the DMFT index, involving data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.

## Project Selection Rationale
* I selected this project to apply data analysis skills on real-world health data, focusing on pandas and visualization libraries.
* It improved my ability to handle complex datasets, perform statistical analysis, and potentially generate meaningful insights into public health issues.

## Major Class Themes
1. Employed pandas DataFrames to filter, clean, and prepare the NHANES datasets for analysis, showcasing the flexibility and power of DataFrames in handling real-world data.
2. Utilized if statements within custom functions to dichotomize outcomes and apply logical conditions, demonstrating the application of basic programming constructs in data analysis.

## Project Improvements
* If redoing the project, I would incorporate more advanced statistical analyses and predictive modeling to deepen the insights gained.
* This would leverage the data more fully and provide a richer understanding of the factors influencing dental health.

## Running the Project
* Ensure pandas, NumPy, seaborn, matplotlib, scipy, and tableone are installed.
* Data are already uploaded in GitHub, however, alternatively these can be downloaded from the NHANES website (OHXDEN_J.XPT and DEMO_J.XPT for 2017-18).
* The notebook guides through data preprocessing and analysis through embedded comments.

## Challenges
* Encountered challenges with data cleaning and merging datasets due to complex data structures and missing values.
* Resolved these through custom cleaning functions and careful dataset merging based on patient identifiers.
